# Walkthrough - 3D BMW Themed Portfolio

## Overview
I have successfully scaffolded and implemented the **3D BMW Themed Portfolio** using React, Vite, and Framer Motion. The project is styled with a premium "High-Performance" aesthetic, featuring a deep matte black background, BMW Electric Blue accents (`#007AFF`), and glassmorphism effects.

## Features Implemented
-   **Hero Section**: Full-screen 3D model placeholder with staggered text animations.
-   **Navigation**: Sticky glassmorphism navbar.
-   **Projects**: Grid layout with 3D tilt effects and neon glow on hover.
-   **Skills**: Floating animated icons grouped by category.
-   **YouTube Gallery**: "AI Unlocked" section with gradient CTA.
-   **Responsiveness**: Mobile-optimized layout (Spline model scales to 60%).

## Source Code
-   **GitHub Repository**: [sandundimantha/-Portfolio](https://github.com/sandundimantha/-Portfolio.git)

## How to Run Locally
1.  Open a terminal in the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd d:/Myportforlio
    ```
2.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
3.  Open your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

## How to Build for Production
To create an optimized production build:
```bash
npm run build
```
The output will be in the `dist` folder, ready for deployment (e.g., to Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages).

## Next Steps (User Action Required)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Spline Embed**: Open `src/components/Hero.jsx` and replace the placeholder comment with your actual Spline Embed URL/Code to see the 3D BMW model.

## Visual Verification
-   **Animations**: Check the smooth fade-in of text and the floating motion of skill icons.
-   **Interactions**: Hover over project cards to see the "Underglow" effect.
-   **Theme**: Verify the matte black background and glass panels on the Navbar.
